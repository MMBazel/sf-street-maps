											<h2>Mapping SF's <strong>Street Art</strong> </h2>
											<p>Storytelling and Street Art, an attempt to document the ever changing nature of neighborhoods</p>
										</header>
										<p>A theme that I wanted to explore with the help of GIS, R, and D3.js is the idea of neighborhoods and art. As a native San Francisco who works in the technology sector I’ve become increasingly aware that the nature of home is in flux. Two years ago I began compiling an album of street art photos (taken by myself) in various neighborhoods, including Mission, SOMA, Haight and Ashbury, Tenderloin and various other locations. With each image I attempted to record as much of the meta-data as possible (location, date-time, sentiments) with the hope that one day I would be able to pin these images and videos to a map that users could then filter and curate individual layers, as well as attach additional media including documents and photos, with the goal of being able to tell their own story of what “home” means to them. 
										</p>
										<p>Two of the biggest challenges identified currently are: 1) Allowing users to snap photos and store them such that important metadata (like coordinates) remain intact with the images; 2) Identifying (and predicting) new sources of street art. 
										</p>
										<p>The most interesting and challenging aspects of this project are: 1) Neighborhood boundaries lack clear definition and are subject to changing definitions; 2) Street art strongly tends to be seen as: subversive, something to be eradicated, “not art” which means there is very little documentation, even for pieces classified as “murals”; 3) The turnover rate of street art locations varies from years to even a few days. I hope to address these at some point in the future as I become better versed in GIS, GPS, and web development. While my GIS program does emphasize the use of ArcGIS, I’m also exploring FOSS alternatives such as QGIS. 
										</p>

										</p>
										<p>Currently my photos are being used to teach college level courses on physical/cultural geography through Professor Duncan, one of the instructors for the GIS program I am currently enrolled in. I also assist with supplementing his lectures with my own notes that draw on experience with database design, querying and reporting. Study guides can be found here: http://bit.ly/1SfwMrp. These are being developed as standalone primers for students who enter the program without the prerequisite knowledge in db design.
